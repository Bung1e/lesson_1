### User Story 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
**Story:**  
"As a data analyst, I want to gather and preprocess social media posts and customer feedback data so that the sentiment analysis can be performed on clean, structured inputs."

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. The system should collect data from at least two sources (e.g., Twitter and customer review platforms).  
2. Data should be cleaned by removing irrelevant content (e.g., hashtags, URLs, special characters).  
3. Preprocessing should include tokenization, stop-word removal, and normalization (e.g., lowercasing text).  
4. The preprocessed data should be stored in a structured format (e.g., CSV or database table).  
5. The system must handle errors gracefully, such as network issues during data collection, and log them for debugging.  
6. A test dataset should be created to verify the preprocessing pipeline, ensuring that input matches expected output profiles.

### User Story 2: Model Training and Evaluation  
**Story:**  
"As a data scientist, I want to train and evaluate a sentiment analysis model so that the system can accurately classify customer sentiment."

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. The model should be trained using labeled sentiment data (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).  
2. The training process should include hyperparameter optimization to improve model accuracy.  
3. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score should be calculated and reported.  
4. The model should achieve a minimum F1-score of 0.85 on the test dataset.  
5. Training and evaluation scripts should be modular and reusable for future iterations.  
6. The system must generate a report summarizing evaluation metrics and model performance for stakeholders.

### User Story 3: Visualization and Reporting  
**Story:**  
"As a product manager, I want to view visualizations of sentiment trends over time so that I can make informed decisions about product and service improvements."

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. The system should generate sentiment trend graphs (e.g., line chart showing sentiment percentages over time).  
2. Visualizations must include filters (e.g., by date range or data source).  
3. Reports should include a summary of sentiment distribution (e.g., pie chart showing proportions of positive, negative, neutral sentiment).  
4. The visualizations must be exportable in PDF and PNG formats for external sharing.  
5. The system should enable drill-down functionality to view sentiment details for specific products or services.  
6. User testing must verify that visualizations are clear, accurate, and easy to interpret.
