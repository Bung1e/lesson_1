### User Story 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing  
**As a Data Engineer, I want to collect and preprocess social media posts and customer feedback so that the data is clean, structured, and ready for sentiment analysis.**

#### Acceptance Criteria:  
1. The system should connect to at least three social media APIs (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) and extract posts containing specific keywords or hashtags.  
2. The system should remove duplicates, irrelevant posts, and spam content during preprocessing.  
3. Text data should be tokenized, normalized (e.g., converting to lowercase, removing punctuation), and saved in a structured format (e.g., CSV or database).  
4. Preprocessed data should include metadata such as timestamps, user location (if available), and sentiment-related keywords.  
5. Unit tests should verify that preprocessing removes duplicates and irrelevant content correctly.

### User Story 2: Model Training and Evaluation  
**As a Data Scientist, I want to train and evaluate a sentiment analysis model so that it accurately predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the collected data.**

#### Acceptance Criteria:  
1. The model should be trained using labeled datasets (e.g., customer feedback datasets or publicly available sentiment datasets).  
2. The model should achieve a minimum accuracy of 85% on a validation dataset.  
3. Evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) should be calculated and displayed for each sentiment category.  
4. The system should allow for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.  
5. Acceptance tests should confirm that the model correctly predicts sentiment for a sample set of 100 posts or customer feedback entries.

### User Story 3: Visualization and Reporting  
**As a Business Analyst, I want to visualize sentiment trends and generate reports so that stakeholders can understand public opinion about products and services.**

#### Acceptance Criteria:  
1. The system should provide interactive charts (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs, and line graphs) showing sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral) over time.  
2. Reports should include breakdowns of sentiment by product category, geography, or customer demographics (if metadata supports it).  
3. Dashboards should allow filtering by date range, platform (e.g., Twitter vs. Instagram), and keywords.  
4. Export functionality should allow users to download sentiment reports in PDF and Excel formats.  
5. Tests should verify that charts update dynamically based on filters and exported reports match the displayed data.
